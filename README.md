# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
Explain the purpose of this analysis.


- Resources 
  - Pandas, Jupyter Notebook
  - LoanStats_2019Q1.csv 
  - scikit-learn and imbalanced-learn libraries


## Results: 
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Six learning modules
1. Naive Random Oversampling
2. SMOTE Oversampling
3. Undersampling
4. SMOTEEN (Combination Over and Undersampling)
5. Balanced Random Forest Classifier
6. Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier 


## Summary: 
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
